/*
Your parser should read successive expressions from standard input, construct
a parse tree for the expression if it is well-formed, and then print that
parse tree to standard output (see description below).
 If the input is not well-formed, your parser should print an appropriate message
and resume processing at the next line of input (i.e., skip to the next
newline).
 You may assume that expressions are on a single line of input if you want, or
deal with multi-line input.
 Your program should exit on end-of-file on standard input.
